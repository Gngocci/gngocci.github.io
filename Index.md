### Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 1

  The first lab that I liked was Lab 1. It may seem like I chose this because it was easy but it’s more of an opener to Computer Science. I had never taken a CS class in high school so in Lab 1 where we started learning how to print words out, in this case, “Hello World!”, I was excited to learn programming for the first time!

* Lab 8, Part 2

  My second favorite lab will have to be Lab 8, part 2. This is the lab we started getting into counters using loops so it was an interesting topic to me. It was cool to see the program building the pattern just by using dashes, lines, and asterisks.

* Lab 6, Part 2

  My third favorite lab is Lab 6, part 2. In this lab, we wrote the program to play BlackJack but it was also the introduction of booleans. It was nice to learn that booleans can only have 2 outcomes, which are true or false, but these options can be applied to much more complicated programs (cooler games) with loops and such if done correctly.
